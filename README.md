# Fabric for Craft CMS 3.5

I'm working here.

![Under Construction](resources/img/underconstruction.gif)

## Notes

* Fabric is a framework for quickly putting together things like asset banks, branding guidelines, staff handbooks etc.
* It can be a private login-only site with the ability to share specific pages.
* Setup is as easy as installing the plugin and pointing it to an asset volume, but has the ability to easily add entries.
* It's being built for Sitemill's clients, but will be a paid plugin once it has matured.
